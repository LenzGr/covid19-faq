There is little to no evidence that masks work in preventing the contraction of the disease, and the CDC and other health authorities [do not recommend them](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html). The United States Surgeon General, in fact, has asked the public to [stop purchasing them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-n95-face-masks.html) for fear of depleting supplies for health professionals. 

Masks can, however, help reduce the spread of the disease from individuals that have already been infected.
