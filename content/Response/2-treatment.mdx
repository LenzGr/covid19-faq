There are no treatments for COVID-19 currently [approved](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html#clinical-management-treatment%3C). An NIH clinical trial of the antiviral remdesivir [has begun](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-remdesivir-treat-covid-19-begins), however, on a patient who contracted COVID-19 on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship and was subsequently repatriated. Originally developed for the Ebola virus, remdesivir has shown some promise in treating the coronaviruses MERS and SARS. 

Per the NIH, however, "Although remdesivir has been administered to some patients with COVID-19, we do not have solid data to indicate it can improve clinical outcomes."
