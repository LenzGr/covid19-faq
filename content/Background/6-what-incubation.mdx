### How long may the virus incubate?
Based on incubation rates for the MERS coronavirus, the CDC estimates the incubation period to be between [2 and 14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html). 

### Is it possible for people to be communicable before they experience symptoms? 
Yes, this appears [to be the case](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic.html), which will make containment vastly more challenging.
